# UKRI Living Benchmarks

This project is developing and curating benchmarks in support of
supercomputer procurement and performance assessment.

It is supported by the [UKRI Digital Research Infrastructure
Programme](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/creating-world-class-research-and-innovation-infrastructure/digital-research-infrastructure/)
under grant APP46895.

UKRI Living Benchmarks is in a development phase.


## Background

## Benchmarks

The suite includes application and synthetic benchmarks.

### Application benchmarks

#### Released

#### Under development

- [DOLFINx](https://github.com/ukri-bench/benchmark-dolfinx) (finite
  element method)
- [NEMO](https://github.com/ukri-bench/benchmark-nemo) (structured grid
  ocean and climate solver)
- [Quantum
  ESPRESSO](https://github.com/ukri-bench/benchmark-quantumespresso)
  (electronic-structure calculations and materials modelling)

#### Planned

- [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/) (molecular dynamics)
- [HemeLB](https://github.com/hemelb-codes/) (lattice Boltzmann)
- [Grid](https://github.com/paboyle/Grid) (lattice QCD)

### Synthetic benchmarks

#### Released

#### Under development

- OSU micro-benchmark suite (OMB)
- pydgemm

#### Planned

- IO500


## Proposing a benchmark

We welcome proposal for new benchmarks. Proposals are assessed against
the the communities the benchmark serves, the methods and algorithms
that it tests, positioning relative to other benchmarks in the suite,
vitality of the developer community, and technical suitability of code.

To be considered for inclusion, a benchmark must be available under an
Open Source Initiative [approved
license](https://opensource.org/licenses).
