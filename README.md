# UKRI Living Benchmarks

This project is deveoping and curating benchmarks in support of supercomputer 
procurement and performance assessment.

It is supported by the
[UKRI Digital Research Infrastructure Programme](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/creating-world-class-research-and-innovation-infrastructure/digital-research-infrastructure/)
under grant APP46895.

## Proposing a benchmark

We welcome proposal for new benchamrks. Proposals are assessed against the the 
communities the benchmark serves, the methods and algorithms that it tests, 
positioming relative to other benchmarks in the suite, vitality of the developer 
community, and technical suitability of code.

To be considered for inclusion, a benchmark must be available under an 
Open Source Initiative [approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses).
